## Abstraction
In OOP, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

## Ecapsulation
Encapsulation is a way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object, so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is the concept in OOPs in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class.

## Polymorphism (w3schools)
Polymorphism occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
